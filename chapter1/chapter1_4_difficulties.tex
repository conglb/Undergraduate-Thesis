\section{Difficulties} 
Hair can be classified into many categories, light or dark, curl or straight, etc. Therefore, many hair segmentation models can recognize hair in black or yellow but fail to the other colors. In addition to multiple variants, hair has an unstable and complex structure, unlike many objects with simple shapes. In terms of clothing, the color and shape of it are also incredibly various. Covering all these possibilities will lead to hardship in hair and clothing recognition, which ought to be resolved in the thesis work.


Nevertheless, smartphones usually constrain the memory of 4 gigabytes in total; thus, standard models would consume a large proportion of memory space. Also, long inference time of standard models is problematic, although hardware accelerators come into handy. One other difficulty in running models on mobile devices is that the size of the output mask is different from the size of the screen. Because of this mismatch, we have to rescale and meticulously render predictions to fit the screen. Furthermore, it is also essential to ensure that pipelines runs consistently on targeted environments and produces identical results with the inputs stay the same.
